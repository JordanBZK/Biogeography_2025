  <title>The Global Administrative Unit Layers  - GAUL 2015</title>
  <abstract>The Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) is an initiative implemented by FAO within the AfricaFertilizer.org project.The GAUL compiles and disseminates the best available information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL always maintains global layers with a unified coding system at country, first (e.g. departments) and second administrative levels (e.g. districts). Where data is available, it provides layers on a country by country basis down to third, fourth and lowers levels. The overall methodology consists in a) collecting the best available data from most reliable sources, b) establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible), c) adding selected data to the global layer based on the last country boundaries map provided by the UN Cartographic Unit (UNCS), d) generating codes using GAUL Coding System and e) distribute data to the users (see TechnicalArticleG2014.pdf).Because GAUL works at global level, unsettled territories are reported. The approach of GAUL is to deal with these areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries (see TechnicalArticleG2014.pdfand G2014_DisputedAreas.dbf).GAUL is released once a year and the target beneficiary of GAUL data is the UN community and other authorized international and national partners. GAUL keeps track of administrative units that has been changed, added or dismissed in the past for political causes. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named "GAUL Set" (see ReleaseNoteGAUL2014.pdf).

The Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all countries in the world.</abstract>
